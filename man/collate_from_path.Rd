\arguments{
\item{path}{The root path to the local repository or R package. Defaults to the
current working directory.}

\item{output_file}{The path for the output text file. If `NULL` (the default),
no file is written.}

\item{copy_to_clipboard}{Logical. If `TRUE` (the default), the collated text is
copied to the system clipboard. Requires the 'clipr' package.}

\item{preamble}{A character string to add to the top of the collated file,
providing context for an LLM. A default preamble is generated if `NULL`.}

\item{include_patterns}{A character vector of regex patterns for file paths
to include.}

\item{exclude_patterns}{A character vector of regex patterns for file paths
to exclude.}
}
\value{
The collated text as a single character string (invisibly).
}
\description{
Scans a local directory, finds relevant source files based on include/exclude
patterns, and combines them into a single text file. The output is
automatically copied to the clipboard for convenience.
